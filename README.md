## Overview
This e-commerce application uses a microservices architecture where each service is responsible for a specific domain:
- **Payment Service**: Manages payment processing.
- **Product Service**: Handles product-related operations.

Each service uses SQLAlchemy for database operations and can be deployed locally using Docker.

## Setup and Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ecommerce-microservices.git
cd ecommerce-microservices
```

### Install Dependencies
For each service:
